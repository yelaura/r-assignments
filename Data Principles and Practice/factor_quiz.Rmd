Create an R factor cf with three levels, red, yellow, and green, consisting of the following elements: red, green, green, yellow, red, red, red, yellow, green.

```{r}
cf <- c(1,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,3)
cf <- factor(lights)
levels(cf) <- c("red", "yellow", "green")
```

A. Print cf

```{r}
print(cf)
```

B. Use str() to display the structure of cf as a string.

```{r}
str(cf)
```

C. Displaying the count and percent of total of each level in cf

```{r}
totals <- table(cf)
pct <- totals / sum(totals)
totals
pct
```

2. Given the following factor of:

```{r}
nf <- factor(c(2,4,7,9.10))
```

A. Print the sum of the elements in nf

```{r}
sum(as.numeric(as.character(nf)))
```

B. What's the GOTCHA! solution to this problem?

factors cannot be treated like a regular vector. They need to be declassed if you want to take the sum or do any arithmetic operations.
