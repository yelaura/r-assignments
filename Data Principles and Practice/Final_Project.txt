Title: SF Pedestrian Safety Scores
Description of Project: The city of San Francisco has many public datasets involving city infrastructure, crime, housing, environment, etc. In my project, I aim to use a few (detailed below) to visualize the typical safety of a pedestrian in the city of San Francisco. I will combine data from location of stop signs and traffic signals to cases opened and also police department incidents to determine the likelihood of an accident involving a pedestrian for each intersection.

Data source for my project (Mainly from data.sfgov.org)
